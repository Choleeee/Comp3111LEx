# Comp 3111: Software Engineering
The following repository consists of the Java Project I developed for the COMP 3111 course under HKUST.

What I have learned so far:
1. Using the IntelliJ IDEA to build and run a Java Project
2. Using Git and GitHub to track my changes and share my projects with others.

Screenshot of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE:
